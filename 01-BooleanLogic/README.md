# Chapter 1: Boolean Logic

For this chapter's project, I built the specified elementary gates in the following order:

0. Nand (given)
1. Not
2. And
3. Or
4. Xor
5. Mux (multiplexor)
6. DMux (Demultiplexor)
7. Multi-bit gates (i.e., Not16, And16, Or16, Mux16)
8. Or8Way
9. DMux4Way, Mux4Way16
10. DMux8Way, Mux8Way16

Each chip may have been built in terms of previously built chips (i.e., earlier in the list order).

The chips listed here are building blocks that will be used for more complex chips in chapter 2, such as the ALU chip.
